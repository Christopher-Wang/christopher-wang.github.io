##### About me
Welcome! I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Kinaxis](https://www.kinaxis.com/) and an incoming graduate student at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/). I am supervised by Professor [Xingyu Li](https://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~xingyu/index.html) and am a researcher with the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (AMII)](https://www.amii.ca/). In the past I worked as a Research Scientist Intern at [Nuance Communications](https://www.nuance.com/) where I worked on homomorphically encrypted representation search and as an Undergraduate Researcher at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/) where I worked in applying deep learning to medicine, conservation, and environmentalism.
