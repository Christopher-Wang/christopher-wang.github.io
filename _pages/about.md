Welcome! I am a graduate student at University College London studying [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning-msc). Formally, I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Kinaxis](https://www.kinaxis.com/) where I work in time-series forecasting for demand sensing and generative AI for documentation retrieval and code generation. In the past, I worked as a Research Scientist Intern at [Nuance Communications](https://www.nuance.com/), where I focused on homomorphically encrypted representation search, and as an Undergraduate Researcher at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/), where I worked on applying deep learning to biomedical image segmentation, orca whale call segmentation, and unsupervised remote sensing. My interests primarily lie in task representations, large unsupervised pre-training, and adversarial examples.
