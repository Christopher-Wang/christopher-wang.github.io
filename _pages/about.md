Welcome! I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Kinaxis](https://www.kinaxis.com/). During my day job, I work in time-series forecasting for demand sensing and generative AI for documentation retrieval and code generation. I am also an incoming graduate student at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) to be supervised by Professor [Xingyu Li](https://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~xingyu/index.html). Furthermore, I will be a researcher with the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (AMII)](https://www.amii.ca/). In the past, I worked as a Research Scientist Intern at [Nuance Communications](https://www.nuance.com/), where I focused on homomorphically encrypted representation search, and as an Undergraduate Researcher at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/), where I worked on applying deep learning to biomedical image segmentation, orca whale call segmentation, and unsupervised remote sensing. My interests primarily lie in task representations, task compression, and adversarial examples for deep learning.
