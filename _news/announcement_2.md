I have joined Kinaxis as a Machine Learning Engineer! Or more accurately I have re-joined Kinaxis following a year long internship where I was able to drive the software architecture design of an automl demand forecasting system. I joined Kinaxis in January of 2019 through my schools co-operative (co-op) education program. As an aside I recommend that all prospecting engineers consider the robustness of a school's co-op program when choosing a program. My decision to rejoin Kinaxis rather than look elsewhere was really because of the impact that I felt I was able to have at the organization. Its really rare for an intern to be able to perform innovative work and have input on major design considerations. Exciting to continue developing my project and see where the winds take me!
