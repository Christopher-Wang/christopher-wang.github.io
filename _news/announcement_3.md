Wow, so much has happened after only two years at Kinaxis! I've survived an acquisition, shifting goalposts, and a return-to-office mandate. Looking back, I really feel that I learned a lot, mostly about the difficulties of bringing enterprise software into production. While functionally many of the features we implemented were (relatively) simple, managing a diverse set of precise security, performance, and regulatory requirements was a lot harder than I anticipated. That said, I am very pleased with what I was able to accomplish after only a single year, including taking the lead on a forecast explainability feature, performing workflow integrations, and implementing a novel data segmentation algorithm in production that enabled the machine learning system to scale, resulting in an 8.19x end-to-end speedup (from 131 hours to 16 hours), an 18.84x reduction in data storage (from 6.8 TB to 361 GB), and a 10.11x reduction in yearly cloud costs (from $1,377,012 to $136,084).
