Wow, so much has happened after only two years at Kinaxis! I've survived an acquisition, shifting goal posts, and a return to office mandate. Looking back, I really felt that I learned a lot, mostly about the difficulties of bringing enterprise software into production. While functionally many of the features we implement were (relatively) simple, managing a diverse set of precise security, performance, and regulatory requirements was a lot harder than I anticipated. That said, I am very please with what I was able to accomplish after only a single year, including taking lead on a forecast explainability feature, performing workflow integrations and implementing a novel data segmentation algorithm in production that enable the machine learning system to scale resulting in a 8.19x end-to-end speed up (from 131 hours to 16 hours), 18.84x reduction in data storage (from 6.8 TB to 361GB), and a 10.11x reduction in yearly cloud costs (from 1,377,012$ to 136,084$).
