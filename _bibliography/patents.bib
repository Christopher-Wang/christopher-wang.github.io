abstract={Systems and methods for features engineering, in which internal and external signals are received and fused. The fusing is based on meta-data of each of the one or more internal signals and each of the one or more external signals. A set of features is generated based on one or more valid combinations that match a transformation input, the transformation forming part of library of transformations. Finally, a set of one or more features is selected from the plurality of features, based on a predictive strength of each feature. The set of selected features can be used to train and select a machine learning model.}
